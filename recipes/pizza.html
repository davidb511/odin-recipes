        <h3>The most delicious food ever made.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 can of pizza crust</li>
            <li>Pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; 
                set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
                Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
                Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, 
                rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
